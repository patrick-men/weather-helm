# weather-helm
This repository contains a few scripts and files that are used in the creation of a helm chart. Said chart deploys a webserver with a dedicated data processing app - the data at hand is weather data taken from the openweathermap API.
Furthermore, with the use of values.yaml and ConfigMaps, a user specific API call is made possible.
